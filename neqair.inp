NEQAIR Input File Template
For versions newer than 14.0, the version number is listed on the first line
The inputs are separated below, each section enclosed by ----'s
The first line in the section is a description
The second line is read by NEQAIR as a character sequence
In some cases additional lines may follow
A blank line ends the input section
Following lines are used for comments and ignored by the code
***************************
Line 0: Header - anything between here and the ---'s writes to stdout

Line 2: Output type : a string of letters indicating one or more output files
ILMS

Allowed input choices for line 2:
(I)ntensity.out - write intensity vs. wavelength (high resolution)
Intensity_(S)canned.out - write the scanned intensity v. wavelength file
(L)OS.out - write radiance versus position on the normal line of sight
(P)opulation - write state population for each atom at each LOS point
(A)bsorbance/Emittance - write absorbance/emittance at each LOS point
(C)oupling.out - data needed for flowfield/radiation coupling
(2) a 2 following an I or S means the output is in columns, where each column is an LOS point
(M) write general messages to stdout
