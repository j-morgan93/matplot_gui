***************************
NEQAIR Input File Template
For versions newer than 14.0, the version number is listed on the first line
The inputs are separated below, each section enclosed by ----'s
The first line in the section is a description
The second line is read by NEQAIR as a character sequence
In some cases additional lines may follow
A blank line ends the input section
Following lines are used for comments and ignored by the code
***************************
Line 0: Header - anything between here and the ---'s writes to stdout
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa <- 1st format line
--------------------------
Line 1: Database path - if empty, looks for local DATABASES directory
/share/apps/neqair/v15.0-prerelease/DATABASES
-------------------------
Line 2: Output type : a string of letters indicating one or more output files
ILMS    

Allowed input choices for line 2:
(I)ntensity.out - write intensity vs. wavelength (high resolution)
Intensity_(S)canned.out - write the scanned intensity v. wavelength file
(L)OS.out - write radiance versus position on the normal line of sight
(P)opulation - write state population for each atom at each LOS point
(A)bsorbance/Emittance - write absorbance/emittance at each LOS point
(C)oupling.out - data needed for flowfield/radiation coupling
(2) a 2 following an I or S means the output is in columns, where each column is an LOS point
(M) write general messages to stdout

--------------------------
Line 3: State population method
N Q L      1.

Allowed input for Line 3:
(B) Boltzmann
(N) Non-Boltzmann followed by (optionally) non-boltzmann method and (required) absorption method.
    Valid choices for method are:
        (Q) Traditional QSS (adjusts ground state)
        (T) Time derivative limited (adjusts slowest eigenvalue)
        (R) Reaction residual limited (adds a reaction rate proportional to Boltzmann distribution)
        (F) Flux limited (adds a term accounting for convection - most stable, recommended, default)
    Valid choices for absorption method include:
        (C) Constant escape factor, followed by the value
        (L) Local Escape factor approximation, followed by a float for d
        (F) Full local calculation, followed by a float for d
        (N) Non-local radiation/QSS coupling
(S) Saha (atoms only)
(F) Input from File (file names pop-xxx-xxx)
(A) Do not calculate state populations, instead read absorption/emission coefficients from files
        ae.nnn.  The order in which to process the nnn files is obtained from LOS.dat
If different settings are desired for molecules and atoms, include a second line for molecules

--------------------------
Line 4: Geometry
 T

Allowed input for Line 4:
(T) Tangent Slab - calculate tangent slab heat flux
(C) Spherical Cap - follow with two floats for Rnose and Shock Div
(S) Shock Tube - follow with a float for tube diameter
(L) Line of Sight - calculate radiance on line
(B) Blackbody function (follow with float for temperature, otherwise uses Tt at first LOS point)
(P) Calculate Populations only (requires P output, Line 2)
(X) Perform scan on existing intensity.out (S must be selected on Line 2)

--------------------------
Line 5: Boundary Conditions
 N
 B

First line is boundary at LOS point 0. Options are:
(B) Blackbody
(I) read Intensity.in
(N) no initial radiance

Second line is boundary at final LOS point
(I) read emissivity.in
(G) Greybody, follow with Emittance/Absorbance (0-1.0) and Transmittance (0-1.0)
(B) Blackbody (at final LOS point temperature)
Note this boundary condition is used to convert data into an absorbed heat flux/radiance
Use 'B' if only the incident radiance/flux is desired
This value does however, materially affect the calculation for Non-local populations

--------------------------
Line 6: Bands
I
N       
O       
 N2+ 1-  
 N2 1+   
 N2 2+   
 NO beta 
 NO gam  
 NO del  
 NO eps  
 O2 SR   

Allowed input:
(A) Include all bands/features that match species list
(O) Omit selected bands or features
(I) Include only selected bands or features

If (O) or (I) is selected, follow with the following (optionally on separate lines):
N, O, C, H, He, Ar, Fe, Al, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, S, Si - available atoms
N2, N2+, NO, O2, CN, CO, C2, H2, NH, CH, CO2, C3, MgO, SiO - available molecules

For atoms, can optionally follow with bf,bb, and/or ff
For molecules, the following band choices can be included
N2 - 1+, 2+, BH2, LBH, BH1, WJ, CY
NO - beta, gam, del, eps, bp, gp, IR
CN - VIO, RED, IR
H2 - B-X, C-X, B'-X
CO - 4+, IR
OH - A-X, IR
MgO - B-X, B-A
SiO - X-A, A-E

Line 7: Regions
   855.50  2000.00 A 10 R 600
  2000.00  6350.00 A 10 R 50
  6350.00 16000.00 A 10 R 50
 16000.00 39600.00 A 10 R 25

A series of lines specifying the region parameters.  This includes:
w1 w2 A/M n Rdd
w1, w2 are wavelength range in Angstrom
A/M is (A)uto or (M)anual Grid Spacing.  This is followed by n, which is:
Grid Spacing (Angstroms) for Manual or
Points per Line for Auto
The next parameter is an optional "Range", with dd being the range value

----------------------------
Line 8 : Scan (Only required if S selected on Line2)
 0.10  Voigt 6.000 0.000      2.
 0.10  Voigt 6.000 0.000      2.
 0.10  Voigt 6.000 0.000      2.
 0.10  Voigt 6.000 0.000      2.

Which follows the format:
Sp Type Param-list
where Sp is the line spacing (float)
Type is the scan type (ICCD1, ICCD2, Voigt, SGauss)
Param-list is a list of scan parameterizations, generally is 2 or 3 float values

----------------------------
Line 9 : Spatial Scan (Optional - ShockTube mode only)
tri 1.0
ICCD1 1.0 0.1
1.0

Which follows the format:
Spatial Scan is the convolution of 3 functions, each specified on consecutive lines
1st line: Optical Function (trap)ezoid or (tri)angular, followed by one or two floats specifying base widths
2nd line: CCD Function: Same options as Scan (Line 8)
3rd line: Temporal Function: Treated as a square, float specifies widths

If this line is present, LOS.out will be the convolution of the true result with this function
If this line is missing, LOS.out will not be convolved

To use a different SRF for each region, repeat these 3 lines N times
